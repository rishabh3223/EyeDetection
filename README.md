# EyeDetection

### Project Overview

Creating a Deep Convolution Neural Network such that it identifies the face in the loaded images in grayscale mode, quickly and accurately. Once the face is found, we create a ROI for the face and apply eye detection on the ROI (since eyes are always on the face).

### Software Requirements

* Anaconda (python platform)
* Packages: numpy, scipy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pillow, H5py
* Haar Cascade Classifiers
